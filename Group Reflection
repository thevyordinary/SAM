## Nguyen Quoc Huy - s3979875

I believe I performed well in this project stage, despite facing pressure from deadlines for other subjects while dealing with a serious health condition. I improved my writing skills, learned to ideate, plan, split tasks, and conduct research.

On the downside, I struggled with managing my time effectively, resulting in a rush during the project. This might impact the outcome's quality, for which I take responsibility. Additionally, I realized my limitations in software development skills, which are crucial for this project, but not a focus in my faculty of Robotics & Mechatronics Engineering. I aim to enhance my understanding of software engineering for future collaborations.

On the positive side, our team functioned smoothly, with no conflicts or disagreements. Everyone was proactive, which helped identify and promptly resolve issues.

This assignment was quite challenging for me. Nevertheless, I learned a substantial amount about the IT industry and had the opportunity to collaborate with my team members. We worked well together and developed a strong bond.

However, with only three team members, we felt the pressure of completing the work within a tight timeframe. Given more time, we could have organized our team's schedule better and carefully selected a teammate who aligns with the team's flow and style.

The most surprising aspect was our ability to manage and overcome challenges despite the limited number of team members. We demonstrated volunteerism and understanding, avoiding misunderstandings and disagreements. This made us a cohesive team.

Through collaboration, I learned a lot from each team member, understanding their strengths and weaknesses for collective growth. Huy's expertise in his field and Phuong's attention to planning and details were particularly enlightening.

This assignment posed significant challenges for me, requiring over two weeks to learn HTML, CSS, and design our website simultaneously. Fortunately, my team members provided substantial support, covering the overall report and allowing me to focus on coding. Everyone completed their tasks on time, enabling me to keep up with the assignment.

However, I acknowledge that our SAM website is not perfect as per my expectations. The UI and feature functions are at the first demo design stage. Given more time, we could have enhanced it further. Additionally, I experienced chronic insomnia symptoms during the project, prompting a desire for a more logical timetable and a healthier lifestyle.

I was pleasantly surprised by the division of skills within our team. Each member excels in different areas, ensuring a fair distribution of tasks. This harmony has prevented any disagreements or conflicts throughout our projects. It built trust among team members.

Working with my team members exposed me to different domains and perspectives, enriching my understanding and fostering strong relationships.
