<h1 style="color: red;">I) Team Profile</h1>
<h2>1. Team Name</h2>
<p>"The Last Of Us" now has come to an end and is no longer our team name. Knowing there are many people like us, and there will be more. We are not alone. We are students, and have the same challenges to overcome - harsh academic exercises.</p>
<p>We were once students, we know the struggles that they are going through, so we end them. Our team brings the solution that is ultimate, best, and it's all IN YOUR POCKET.</p>
<p>IN YOUR POCKET (or IYP) is chosen to be our official team name, with the mission of bringing solutions to students in their studies, anytime and anywhere. The idea of IYP is to make something that is accessible to everyone at ease, and this is similar to the concept where you just simply put something in your pocket and take it out when needed, and it will play a vital role in everyone's study life so that they will bring it everywhere, like mobile phones, or we can say, exactly in mobile phones.</p>
<h2> 2. Personal Information</h2>

<h3>Nguyen Quoc Huy -s3979875</h3>
<p>My name is Huy, and the ID is s3979875. I am 100% Saigonese. I see myself as a person of experience, joy and versatility. I love trying new things and getting to know about the world. After my high school graduation in 2019, I spent time finding the characteristics of myself by learning and doing other things outside the university. Luckily, in 2021 I had an opportunity to study abroad in Germany for one year. After experiencing faculties, culture, achievements in Germany, I found out the love for Engineering, so I decided to come back to Vietnam in the summer of 2022 and start my journey to be an engineer in RMIT University Vietnam.</p>
<p>I am writing this introduction at the end of my 3rd semester at the university. Unfortunately I have no experience in software engineering, so this project is a challenge for me. However, I am confident that I am easily adaptive and can catch up with people at a ground state of knowledge. Through this project, I am also able to expand my comfort zone to have more relationships with future engineers, and also knowledge from different fields of engineering.</p>

<h3>Vo Hong Thuy Vy -s3981136</h3>
<p>I am Vo Hong Thuy Vy, my student ID is s3981136. I come from Ho Chi Minh city, but my heritage comes from the ancient capital of Hue. I tend to indulge myself in books and I would describe myself as a homebody. In 2020, I had a chance to read an article discussing the pervasive impact of Information Technology in many life aspects, that is when I decided to pursue this major in RMIT University Vietnam.</p>
<p>This is my first semester in RMIT. I have gained a lot more knowledge about this domain. The RMIT University environment and the knowledge that is created intelligently and in detail, has given me a lot of practicality and desire for the field I chose. I also extend my relationships with people in different domains and also have some solid friends there. My expected career is a Data Scientist or Data Scientist in a global company. I believe that the time and devotion I spent in RMIT will be priceless.</p>

<h3>Trinh Ngoc Minh Phuong - s4015832</h3>
<p>My name is Trinh Ngoc Minh Phuong, my student ID is s4015832. I have spent my time indulging in indoor activities; for example, playing games, listening to music, and surfing social media. The reason why I got interested in Information Technology is because when I took part in an AI exhibition tour, conducted by one university. That is when I decided to follow this major for my future.</p>
<p>I used to study at FPT university but I quit for some personal reasons, and RMIT is well-known in the technology industry so I am continuing my learning journey in RMIT University Vietnam. For three months, I have spread my knowledge and relationship with talented people in different domains. I want to become a full-stack developer, hence I am still a freshman but I believe that I will contribute my best. </p>

<p>Comments on Audit Trail</p>
    <p>
        The audit trail allows us to accurately reflect the work of our group. Our team chose to update and commit the changes over the final two days of the project, as we can see from the commit history on the Github repository. Because we believe that each member requires time to work carefully on their assigned task and wait for it to be evaluated by the others, before uploading it to the repository. Additionally, the website was finished on the final day because there was not enough staff. We push the website into the final repository folder after making sure it runs properly. This method reduced the amount of editing the other commits and minimized team conflicts. Each contribution specifies a unique achievement, enabling us to keep track of progress and timely investigate issues. To reduce the confusion and complexity, we made the decision to work directly on the main branch. As a result, it enables us to focus on our particular tasks while maintaining our dedication to the overall project progress.
    </p>

<h1 style="color: red;">III) Project Description</h1>

<h2>1. Overview</h2>

<h3>Topic</h3>

<p>Due to the increased demand for a new technology that can completely solve many compulsory subjects in school, for instance, Math or Physics, only by scanning, entering files with those problems or even finishing this stage vocally. Furthermore, due to the inability to provide accurate and quick answers in the current existing applications. We aim to develop a single app to assist students with their academic work.</p>

<p>This project aims to develop cutting-edge technology that will only be used by Vietnamese high school students, such as a mobile phone app or other high-tech devices. This application uses the latest technological advancements and artificial intelligence (AI). The end result will include a full justification for every response and every question on every topic taught in high school.</p>

<h3>Motivation</h3>

<p>Our distinct high school educational experiences served as our inspiration for working on this project. We found that the latest version of AI-based learning tools, such as QANDA, Dicamon, and PhotoMath, do not allow us the flexibility to enter the questions. Additionally, the algorithms used in those programs only look for previously solved answers and a propensity to interpret input questions incorrectly. Additionally, we examine, evaluate, and then apply into our invention some modern IT trends, particularly integrated AI-assistant features to answer, help with foreign language subjects, and Intelligent Recommendation will offer personalized solutions based on the users' strengths, preferences, and potential improvement areas[1]. Finally, we think that not only pupils but also individuals in need may find our website valuable. Developing the website will require a wide range of skills: web programming, collecting user experience, soft skills, project management and collaboration. The concept of AI-based learning is not new, but our solution will be the most thorough and sophisticated AI-based learning currently on the market to attract potential employers.</p>

<h3>Landscape</h3>

<p>Since this concept has been extremely popular due to the advance in artificial intelligence, we acknowledge that several problems will occur when we choose and develop it. Several significant rivals: QANDA (<a href="https://qanda.ai/vi">https://qanda.ai/vi</a>)[2], Dicamon (<a href="https://dicamon.vn">https://dicamon.vn</a>)[3], PhotoMath (<a href="https://photomath.com/en">https://photomath.com/en</a>)[4] have created products that are comparable to ours. The QANDA website, developed by Mathpresso Inc., served as the most intelligent to scan math problems and provide detailed solutions. In a similar way, the websites for Dicamon and PhotoMath use the same methods that use optical character recognition to answer the questions. These websites provide numerous options for a single question so that students can select the most appropriate ones as they help students in their educational path. After examining the competitors' advantages: offer a mobile application, a user-friendly interface, and a large answer database. Our main objective is to create an AI assistant to help students in grades 10, 11, and 12. The website will provide consumers a variety of features and functions while upholding a user-friendly interface and designs as a result of our virtual assistant's logical and imaginative training. This has made the project created by our team stand out from the competition in the market.</p>

<h2>2. Detailed Description</h2>

<h3>a. Aims</h3>

<p>In recent years, learning has gotten more challenging and competitive, while technology has advanced and improved. Since then, there has been an increase in demand from students for educational answer tools that would be integrated into computers and smartphones. Additionally, the AI-based learning systems that are currently accessible are unable to fully resolve and provide a clear explanation. After fully comprehending user requirements, our goal is to develop new AI-based learning with the most advanced capabilities. Hence, there would be a potential for our team to develop a new technology that will be the most advanced and comprehensive aid for Vietnamese pupils.</p>

<p>In order to compete with other platforms, we first conducted a poll on people's opinions of AI-based learning to identify the applications' shortcomings. This approach has produced outcomes with a wide range of user viewpoints; some features require improvement or full resolution. Two of our standout features are the AI assistant and the thorough explanation. Students will benefit from having adequate preparation before any test or exam. Our application also allows users to enter questions using any format they like, including text, scanning, photos, or voice. The users will save time and effort. As a result of this, our application may confidently compete consistently with other platforms.</p>

<p>After the planning phase, we decided to collect data and consult with the seniors about the viability. This is the most important stage that we need to go over. We have to divide our task among three people in order to research related techniques and schedule a consultation with our guidance. The development of the application demo on the GitHub repository then begins. We believe that the earlier a project is started, the more issues will be resolved quickly.</p>

<p>The User Interface's final objective is to smoothly satisfy users' needs, provide a multi-functional interface, help users understand the entire website, and perform other technical tasks. Due to the fact that it is essential to any application's success. Sketch, wireframe, mockup, and prototype are the four processes we will take to create the interface in order to showcase a well-designed application.</p>

<h3>b. Plans and Progress</h3>

<p><strong>Stage 1: Ideas initiation</strong></p>

<p>In the beginning, Quoc Huy considered a new technology that would work with AI assistants, using ChatGPT as an illustration. Due to the advancement in AI areas, he believes it would be fascinating to develop a new application using AI. Huy's concept was deemed to be extremely inventive and IT-related by the rest of the group. Minh Phuong offered unique suggestions for educational software. Due to the member learning experiences with the existing application, Thuy Vy came up with the idea that an AI-learning-based system can properly handle students' inquiries. The following day, everyone gathered and began formulating ideas for their tasks, and talked about our project's overall strategy. IYP is still debating project names, which should relate to Software Programs, Students, and Artificial Intelligence. After much deliberation, we chose to call the project as Student AI Mentor (SAM).</p>

<p><strong>Stage 2: Idea generation and development</strong></p>

<p>In the next step, we come up with concepts, and highlight the main characteristics and features of the website. We took great care when designing the user homepage, paying special attention to how quickly and easily users could download and use our website. Following that, we established the specific main components of our website. The virtual design had to be created first in order for the project prototype to be clear and attracted to potential users. We determined the categories' purposes and selected a few of them to develop for our website. 
<P>Social media: Sharing stories, motivation and mission of IN YOUR POCKET.
    Information and Education: The website offers in-depth details regarding AI help for users. 
    Registration and Profile Management: Users can quickly register and manage their profiles, including updating their personal information.
    Download: The website offers the App Store and Google Play installers to assist consumers in downloading the application.
    Support and Contact Information: Contact details and customer support features are provided for the users.
    FAQ: commonly asked questions that users can easily access. 
    </P>
<p><strong>Stage 3: Timetable and Progress</strong></p>
<p><ins>a. Timetable</ins></p>
<p>Project proposal and project execution are the two steps that make up the project timetable. The following chart displays the project milestones for each phase.</p>
<img src="/Users/cakeko/Downloads/IMG_9644.jpg" alt="Tables of timetables">
<img src="/Users/cakeko/Downloads/IMG_9645.jpg" alt="Tables of timetables" style="width:1120px;height:350px;" >

<p><ins>b. Actual Progress </ins></p>
    <p>  According to the aforementioned timeline, the Student AI Mentor mock-up we created only included five main features: Home, About SAM, Grades, Download, and Account. Make the website's Home page the main landing page. This section's categories include an IN YOUR POCKET's introduction, inspiration, and mission. To further divide each application category, our team further divides the Categories segment into subsections. About SAM, Grades, Download, and Account are some of these subsections. In the ABOUT SAM features, there are certain unique characteristics. This serves as instruction for our SAM assistance and demonstrates its role and expertise. Before installing SAM, users can test it.
        </p>
    <p>The Grades part is a section that focuses on Grades 10, 11, and 12, particularly thirteen topics in high school in Vietnam. Detailed instructions for using the integrated SAM are also provided. This area will provide download information and links to the Appstore and Google Play for the Download section. The Account feature, which stores personal data, is the last.</p> 
    <p>Our team took its time selecting the website's development tools after the brainstorming session was over. Due to its functionality and effectiveness, we utilized the software “visual studio code” to design and construct the website, but we still need to gain experience with it. As a result, we encountered design problems and could only recollect a few of the tool's intricate features. Despite their high effectiveness, other tools were not practical for our work.</p>
    <p>Our team members spent two days searching for the suggested website design before deciding on the layout for the site. After carefully evaluating two viable possibilities, we ultimately chose to adopt the restaurant website template from "the original" website[5]. Based on this model, Phuong created her own version. Huy and Vy are in charge of the overall aesthetic and carefully examine the design.</p>
    <p>The functionality of the website also occurred to be increased as we were creating our own. There are also other items, such as the Account feature. We made the decision to put the login feature first; after users log in or create an account, they are taken to the Home page. The user may access all of their profile information, purchase information, and logout functionality in this section. The packages for which users are currently paying will be visible to users. 
        Finally, we ensure the project's overall progress. We were not just checking for the functionality of the website, but also for the accuracy of the report. We completed each work on time by strictly following the schedule, which helped the project to run smoothly.
        </p>

        <h3>c. Roles</h3>
        <p>In order to remain the equity in the group, we decided not to vote for a leader. We discuss together to see what is coming up and what is the next step to do. We are all cooperative and constructive, so there are no conflicts in the team until present. Our member quantity of 3 is also perfect when it comes to harsh decisions and need to vote for one of the solutions.
            However, due to the complexity of the project and the difference in abilities of members, each of us will have different tasks to do. Minh Phuong is nominated to be a Web Designer since she is the only spark in the team who has knowledge on HTML, CSS to build a website. Thuy Vy and Quoc Huy have a mission as Data Researchers, to collect data and send Minh Phuong regular updates about the project to build a proper promotion website. Furthermore, both of us will have to consider splitting the right phases for the team to work efficiently and finish before the deadline. The paperwork is also held by Vy and Huy in order to help Phuong fully concentrate on web development.

        <h3>d. Scope and Limits</h3>
        <p>
            "There's no such thing as perfection. You're never finished with a film. You run out of time." -- Peter Jackson, director of 'The Lord of the Rings’ and ‘The Hobbit’ trilogies.
        </p>

        <h4>Scope</h4>
        <p>
            "Student AI Mentor (SAM)" application, which combines generative AI to solve exercises, should contain basic functions as a normal app with calculation tools, however, it will be enhanced by AI through its ability to “think” of possibilities of the current problems and deploy specific solutions. Furthermore, due to the high demand for solutions for other less popular subjects in schools, more tools are added to SAM, to have a variety of approaches than just typing in questions.
            ...
            <!-- Include the remaining content for the scope section -->
        </p>
        <p>According to Vietnam Government, the newest list of subjects required to study in high schools are divided into groups, which are:
            Compulsory (7): Math, Literature, Foreign Language 1, Physical Education, National Defense and Security Education, Experience and Career Guidance activities, Content Local Education
            Elective (1): Ethnic Minority Language, Foreign Language 2
            5 subjects selected from 3 subject groups (each group chooses at least 1 subject):
            Social Science: History, Geography, Economic Education and Law
            Natural science subjects: Physics, Chemistry, Biology
            Technology and Arts: Technology, Informatics, Art
            </p>
        <p>We were also having debates, evaluating and coming to the decision that there are minor subjects that are not too difficult to be dependent on study apps, so we get rid of them. The list of remaining subjects for developing SAM contains: Math, Literature, Foreign Language (1 & 2), History, Geography, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Technology, Informatics, Art, Physical Education, Civic Education, National Defense and Security Education.
        </p>
        <p>Based on the list, the tools for collecting input data should be flexible. Camera scanning, Keyboard Typing, Voice Recognition/Tracking, etc., and any tool that we can think of, are suitable, popular, and needed for the difference between subjects, so we decided to have a virtual assistant to help students define what subjects that students need help in and suggest suitable tools to collect data, then use it to collect input data. That virtual assistant is also enhanced by AI in order to learn an individual’s habits, memorize and determine which subjects are frequently asked and improve the response speed from that.</p>
        <p>After defining the subject that needs to be worked on, AI will define the type of information needed, head to the proper available online source, collect and give answers, and display them on screen with the way of expression that is frequently used in that subject. For instance: 
            If it is Math, it shows formulas, calculation steps and results with explanations. 
            If it is English, it shows tenses, which grammar is being used, structure in sentences, etc. 
            If it is History, it shows events related to input date and time, what caused that event, who is involved in that event, what is the impact, consequences, casualties, and further details.
            If it is Art, it shows instructions (photos, videos) to draw, theories, samples, examples, etc.
            </p>
        <p>The desired output is simply proper answers/solutions that help students understand what they are struggling with, with the highest accuracy and efficiency.</p>
        <h4>Limits</h4>
        <p>
            Due to the huge impact of generative AI on every aspect, we have to decide what we mean to solve. In my opinion, a good project is a project that can point out specific problems and specific solutions for only them. The harsh problem of developing a study application with generative AI, we have to ensure the quality of sessions and answers given to be the most accurate. Our team is not considered to be professional, so undergraduate students and above will not be put in our scope due to the fact that our team has a huge concern about the complexity and academics of subjects in universities...
            <!-- Include the remaining content for the limits section -->
        </p>
        <p>So, our market is high school students. Knowledge and exercises from Grades 10 to 12 are not quite as complex as undergraduate level and above, on the other hand, not as easy as lower grades to complete. This limitation gives us enough time to train the AI model to fit in and it will be able to fully understand the concept of other less popular subjects (besides those related to math) on how questions are made, how they should be answered and how to express them in a proper way. Moreover, training AI is a long-term mission, so it should only concentrate on high school knowledge, for the best outcome.
        </p>

        <h3 >e. Tools and Technologies</h3>
        <p>
            To provide users with a UI experience, we developed the front end of our website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Phuong has worked with HTML and CSS before, though. The remaining members of the team are unfamiliar with this language. As a result, Phuong offers to be in charge of developing the website and get exposed to JavaScript at the same time. Using GitHub, Huy and Vy, who are both in charge of administration and collaboration, share and track code for group projects...
            <!-- Include the remaining content for the tools and technologies section -->
        </p>
        <p>The nowadays technologies provide us with advanced facilities, so the expectation in hardware is no longer an issue. Any modern mobile device’s specs now should be supportive in using SAM through iOS or Android.
        </p>

        <h3>f. Testing</h3>
        <p>
            We encountered some substantial obstacles when creating the SAM website. To identify the problems and shortcomings of our websites, we repeatedly tested them throughout the development process. We used empirical assessment to analyze and then implement new improvements in this project because it is quite large and complex. More testing phrases are undertaken as our product develops...
            <!-- Include the remaining content for the testing section -->
        </p>
        <p>Users were invited to test our website. Two of them were our developers, one of whom is also our senior instructor, and the other two were users chosen at random. The programmers on our team are RMIT University information technology majors, and they also teach senior courses in our major. We alternate between duties that were not allocated to us being verified and tested. The goal is to evaluate the website's operation and synchrony with all specifications, including the web's interactivity, user interface, and themes for Student AI Mentor. We guarantee that every task will be completed and that the progress will be checked. We also pay close attention to how quickly pages load and how stable our website is when we need lots of users to interact. Aside from that, user experience is the primary consideration when testing the website. We interact with those who have tested our website and solicit their input. This helps in the completion of our invention.
        </p>
        <P>In conclusion, we have altered the design theme and functionality for user convenience, taking into full consideration every user's feedback. However, we need to update and finish our websites if we want to run this application cross-platform. </P>

        <h3>g. Timeframe</h3>
        <p>Since we are only at the early stages of the SAM project, we design a plan for project development, illustrated in the table below, in order to have a stable workflow.

       <h3>h. Risks</h3>
        <p>
            Risks are inevitable in projects. Greater projects come with greater risks. By evaluating, we initially conclude the very first potential issues existing in developing a study assistant application that has AI integration will be classified and ranked specifically as follows:
        </p>
        
                <h4>Technical Errors</h4>
                <p>
                    Technical errors, by means, are errors related to tools and technologies applied that may cause conflicts or incompatibility within the app structure. The types of technical errors are various and complex, so we have filtered a few popular and remarkable issues below. Over Budget is also classified as a technical issue, since there is unexpected expansion, cancellation, or replacement of tools and technologies being used in the project.
                </p>
                <h4>Team Conflicts</h4>
                <p>
                    It is also common that when team working, we can harshly avoid debates and disagreements among the workflow. Communication, Ideation, and Evaluation are 3 most competitive stages when it comes to teamwork. In fact, our team rarely has conflicts, however, risks are always there.
                </p>

        <h4>Risks Assessment Table</h4>

        <h3>i. Group Processes and Communication</h3>
        <p>
            Communication methods:
            Early on, IN YOUR POCKET decides to share contact information. To share the meeting time and place, we establish various channels of communication group chat and use that platform as our primary tool. Use Google Meet as a forum for task discussion and address the challenges the team has solved while working on the project. We set our timetable to meet four times a week, with a face-to-face meeting on Wednesday and online meetings on the other days, depending on the schedules of the group members.
        </p>
        <p>
            Daily Updated Report and Announce Project Progress:
            Google Docs is picked as a tool to assist the group in storing and sharing essential documents and information. Each team member continuously updates their task and posts any updates on Facebook Messenger for the other team members to recognize the process is proceeding. A face-to-face meeting allows us to quickly help each other with their task problems and manage the workload. We need the task bond to ensure that jobs are completed to a high standard and by the draft deadline. Peer review will be used to evaluate each person's contribution to the group effort.
        </p>
        <p>
            Workplace Management:
            Our team uses the GitHub repository to store and manage the programming files and research documents for this project. We made use of the online collaboration tool Google Docs to store our content as well as project drafts, brainstorming files, and other materials. As GitHub is only used to manage our coding files, Visual Code Studio is used instead for programming. But after that, we will upload it to GitHub.
        </p>
        <p>
            Team Processes and Dynamics:
            To find an ultimate solution, each of us has the responsibility to announce everyone in the team whenever one has problems. In the scenario that a person is not able to finish their task before the deadline, that individual should update his/her current progress to the team and have a discussion on what to do next in order to keep the project on track. This helps everyone face less stress from the amount of work. Until now, our group has had no problem in communication. However, to have good preparation, everyone in the team can bypass one’s absence and take over the one’s task, and that person has to give rational reasons for absence afterwards, whenever he/she is unexpectedly off the grid.

        <h1 style="color: red;">IV) Skills and Jobs</h1>
        <p>
            Due to the lack of employees working on it at the moment, it would be a tremendous change if venture capitalists granted us the option to extend this project. This would improve the precision and efficiency of the development process. Technical capabilities and soft skills make up the two sections of the hiring requirements. We are searching for dependable and skilled personnel to help us achieve our long-term business objective. The project should carry out the activities listed in this development plan, which include establishing an AI assistant, a three-month schedule, gathering data, and building the model.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our SAM project already has 4 positions in charge of Project Manager, Quality Tester and Technical Advisor. We maintain the consistency of the system and generate project ideas and technical functions. Technically speaking, we are looking for candidates for four positions: backend developers, a data analyst, and two software engineers.
        </p>

        <h4>Back-end Developer</h4>
        <p>
            The ability to build up the server and database structure, specifically choosing and configuring the right technological stack, is necessary for this position's members. Additionally, we are searching for someone in this role who has strengths in building API. The tasks listed below fall under the purview of a back-end developer:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Have a solid understanding of performance requirements and objectives, to build high-efficient solutions.</li>
            <li>Create and manage application programming interfaces (APIs).</li>
            <li>Create storage and acceptance solutions for websites, especially those that process payments.</li>
            <li>Entails writing, testing, and maintaining development solutions for issues with code.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            A person with experience as a DevOps Engineer or Software Engineer is advantageous. We nevertheless appreciate ambitious members who have no fear of making errors and learn from them.
        </p>

        <h4>Data Analyst</h4>
        <p>
            In this project, we required an individual who has the ability to translate the raw data into logical insights. Ensuring the accuracy and quality of the core data. That will contribute to providing comprehensible illustrations for our users and stakeholders. The essential skills that we are looking for as a data analyst:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Correcting coding issues and other relevant issues, and removing corrupted data.</li>
            <li>Rearranging data in a legible way through the creation and upkeep of databases and data systems.</li>
            <li>Filter data by looking into reports and performance metrics to find and fix coding issues.</li>
            <li>The diagnosis and prognosis could benefit from using statistical methods to find, examine, and interpret patterns and trends in complex data sets.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The ideal candidate will have good communication and presentation skills as well as proficiency with data analytic tools including R, Python, and SQL. This will eventually provide a strong rigor for the project.
        </p>

        <h4>Two AI Software Engineers</h4>
        <p>
            An employee who fills this role through recruiting is in charge of testing and qualifying as well as artificial intelligence (machine learning, deep learning). Two employees will be hired for this position in order to increase productivity and reduce workload strain. Due to the lack of experience and expertise on our team in developing AI-based learning products. An AI software engineer's primary responsibility in this project is to productize data science research so that it can benefit internal stakeholders or external clients. Additionally, an AI software engineer is in charge of keeping up with the possibilities for transferring our technology, a significant undertaking that includes:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Build Infrastructure as Code</li>
            <li>Continuous Integration and Versioning Control</li>
            <li>Tests</li>
            <li>API Development</li>
            <li>Development of Pilots and MVP Applications</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            In general, we are searching for a highly skilled candidate with experience in the field of software engineering, problem-solving skills and a high tolerance for stress are also needed.

        <h4>Nguyen Quoc Huy - s3979875</h4>
        <p>
            I believe that I have done well in this stage of the project, even though I experienced the pressure of deadlines for other subjects while I was in quite serious health condition. I have well improved my writing skills and learned to do ideation, plan, split tasks and do research.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the other hand, I have not noticed practicing my time management skills, which resulted in a rush while doing the project. This could affect the quality of the outcome and I may have responsibility for that consequence. Furthermore, I found out my limitations in software development skills through this project, due to the fact that this project is to develop a study assistant application, and it requires coding skills, which is not so important in my faculty of Robotics & Mechatronics Engineering. However, I should get to know about software engineering, in case I have to work with many software engineers on projects.
        </p>
        <p>
            Besides, I think every member of the team has been working together really well since we have had no conflicts or disagreements until now, so there is nothing to complain about teamwork. Everyone works together and is always active, so the problems are found and solved immediately afterwards.
        </p>

        <h4>Vo Hong Thuy Vy - s3981136</h4>
        <p>
            This assignment is a really tough one for me. By the end, I have learned a decent amount about the IT industry,
            also having a chance to meet and collaborate with the current members. We get along and continually become each
            other's beloved major friends.  Moreover, I have improved my writing abilities to fit with the assignment’s objectives and rubric and it will play an important role when I get into the labor environment. 
        </p>
        <p>However, with our group consisting of only three people, there is greater pressure on us to complete our work within the limited time. Although we did a good job on the work, if we had more time, we should have organized our team's schedule better. And with considerably more consideration when selecting a teammate who fits with the team's flow and manner.</p>
        <p>The fact that we can manage and overcome numerous challenges in spite of the lack of members surprised me the most. We guarantee volunteers and comprehension, we avoid misunderstandings and disagreements. It has consequently helped us to become a solid team with no disagreements.</p>
        <p>When I have collaborated with others, I have also learned a lot. Every member has shared their strong points and weak points for improvement, giving us the opportunity to grow together. Huy in particular has helped us apply his degree to our project and taught me a lot about it. I learned the value of planning and details from Phuong. Overall, it improves my proficient skills and abilities.</p>
     
    </section>

    <section>
        <h4>Trinh Ngoc Minh Phuong- s4015832</h4>
        <p>
            I find that this assignment is really challenging, I need to spend more than two weeks learning HTML, CSS
            languages and designing our website at the same time. Fortunately, the other members have helped me a lot, they
            cover the overall report so that I could have time and concentration on coding. And everyone finished their
            tasks on time as they were assigned, this helps me a lot to keep up with the assignment.
        </p>

        <p>However, I think our SAM website is still not perfect as I expected, since the UI and feature functions are still on our first demo design. But due to the time limit, this is one of the best websites that we created.  Furthermore, I suddenly have a chronic insomnia symptom while working on this project, so if I have a chance I want to change my timetable to be logical and have a healthy lifestyle.</p>
        <p>I was quite surprised that each member is good at different parts in the project, we manage and share tasks equally. For that reason, we never get into any disagreement or conflict for the past two teams' projects. It has helped me trust our team members more.  
        </p>
        <p>I gained further knowledge about different domains from teammates, and also have different perspectives and ideas while working together. Hence, I have a chance to learn and share with new people and form tight knit relationships with them.

        <h4>IN YOUR POCKET Reflection</h4>
        <p>
            Through 12 weeks of studying Introduction to Information Technology, the three of us - Quoc Huy, Thuy Vy, Minh
            Phuong, had the opportunity to meet and collaborate with each other. Vy and Phuong are studying the same field, Information Technology, and the two of them have a chance to meet each other before entering the university. For that reason, they have a close-knit relationship; however, Quoc Huy is from a different major - Hardware Engineering, and this is his first opportunity to gain exposure to the software field. We initially had no idea that we could operate as efficiently as this, with the overall process going smoothly and the three of us never arguing till now.  We can confidently say that the whole group put all their energy and dedication into the group assignment. 
        </p>
        <p>The first team assignment was not difficult, and we effortlessly got through it. But when it comes to this project, which is the hardest one, we had little experience using programming languages, so we must constantly study and work for it. Due to their accessibility and real-time interaction, Microsoft Teams and Facebook Messenger are our primary means of communication. We assure that we will share any update and discuss issues that demand rapid retrieval. The frequent update, delivering feedback that helps our team maximize the quality and team’ bonding.</p>
        <img src="/Users/cakeko/Downloads/IMG_0136.PNG">   
        <p>We utilize Google Docs and Microsoft Word for document storage, and Visual Studio Code and the Github repository are where we store our code. Without a doubt, these technologies made group work much more convenient and productive. Google Docs facilitates parallel cooperation, and Microsoft Word is utilized to update the report's overall layout.  The development of technology has provided us with numerous options to share our enthusiasm and commitment for this project.</p>
        <img src="/Users/cakeko/Downloads/IMG_0137.PNG">
        <img src=/Users/cakeko/Downloads/IMG_0138.PNG>
        
    
        <p>In conclusion, our dream is getting closure. Through the support and trust that every member has spread. Even though we only had the opportunity to collaborate on one subject, we got along better than ever.</p>
